      --aux                      Generate aux signer data instead of sending a tx
  -b, --broadcast-mode string    Transaction broadcasting mode (sync|async|block) (default "sync")
      --daemon-name string       The name of the executable being upgraded (for upgrade-info validation). Default is the DAEMON_NAME env var if set, or else this executable (default "zetacored")
      --deposit string           deposit of proposal
      --description string       description of proposal
      --dry-run                  ignore the --gas flag and perform a simulation of a transaction, but don't broadcast it (when enabled, the local Keybase is not accessible)
      --fee-granter string       Fee granter grants fees for the transaction

      --gas string               gas limit to set per-transaction; set to "auto" to calculate sufficient gas automatically. Note: "auto" option doesn't always report accurate results. Set a valid coin value to adjust the result. Can be used instead of "fees". (default 200000)
